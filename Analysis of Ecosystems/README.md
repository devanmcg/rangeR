# rangeR/Analysis of Ecosystems

## Background 

This is a repository for publically-available material for my graduate-level class *Analysis of Ecosystems*, which I teach at North Dakota State University. 
Most of this course lives on NDSU's Google Drive and Blackboard but I'm trying to migrate (and organize) here for sharing beyond NDSU.

## Folders

### Weekly class materials 

Folders that begin with numbers contain script for each week, organized in weekly order, identified by topic. 

### Homework 

Poorly organized right now, but contains weekly assignments, templates, and solutions. 

### Example datasets 

Data dependencies for in-class assignments and homework. 

### Scripts 

Incomplete right now. 
Mostly custom scripts referred to in coursework that should be called with *source()*.
